# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

### Client Overview and Software Requirements

I had the opportunity to collaborate with **The Gaming Room**, a client aiming to expand their game **Draw It or Lose It** into a web-based platform. This game, inspired by the classic 1980s game show **Win, Lose, or Draw**, features teams competing to guess images drawn in real time. The primary requirements included developing a scalable, secure web application that supports multiplayer functionality, effective team management, and unique identifiers for both players and games.

### Strengths in Documentation Development

In crafting the design document, I was effective in articulating the system architecture and incorporating relevant design patterns. The inclusion of detailed diagrams, such as UML models, for a clearer understanding of the relationships between various components of the application.

### Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process

The process of creating the design document proved invaluable in identifying potential challenges early in the development cycle. By delineating the requirements and constraints, I was able to address issues related to scalability and memory management. This approach simplifying the coding stage, minimizing the need for extensive revisions later on.

### Areas for Improvement

If given the chance to revise one aspect of my work, I would enhance the **Evaluation** section. I believe a more thorough examination of how each platform's strengths and weaknesses directly influence gameplay would provide stronger justification for the recommendations made regarding the operating platform and development tools.

### Interpreting User Needs in Software Design

I interpreted user needs through feedback from potential players of **Draw It or Lose It**. By the clients requirements, I gathered the desired features such as real-time interaction and cross-device accessibility. Considering user needs is Critical in software design, as  the final product should meet the user expectations.

### Approach to Software Design

My approach to designing the software combined Agile methodologies with user-centered design principles. I iterative feedback, allowed for adjustments based on client and user input throughout the development process. In future projects, I plan to use  techniques such as user story mapping and testing to further polish requirements and design for the user needs.
